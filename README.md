# What is Social Campus?

The purpose of Social Campus  is to ease finding events and announcements that are published on all Akdeniz’s faculties/departments’ different websites. The system is based on ML and a relational database with its classification and filtering functions. All the information about the announcements is scraped, stored and maintained in that database on a web server.
